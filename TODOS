TODO rules: If it starts with 1, it has already been successfully improved/implemented. If it starts with 0, it needs to be implemented/improved. Always remember: add debug to everything!
ALWAYS update this TODO list! Also always add a help command for all commands and make them default if user run it without arguments.
When implementing something, use the way you think would be better.

0 - add a GUI desktop using LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library); this gonna be done after we add and improve the most important command lines.
How are we going to make it?
Taskbar:
- Start menu (left)
- A file explorer icon pinned (left)
- Clock (right)

---
1 - Important: add very robust support to quotation marks ("") and single quotes ('') for ALL filesystem commands like cd, mkdir, rm and many others. Mainly to be able to manage and browser directories with whitespaces.
1 - Recurrent: make ALL current command lines (except `cd`) including `greq`, `gpkg`, `cat` and others external system packages as well as making packages being installed in /bin/apps/ for external packages and /bin/apps/system/ for system default packages.
1 - In source code, system packages source code will now going to be located at /packages/system/<sys_package>/<sys_package_src>
0 - Add a robust account management. Make the default root account: `gemini` (also for liveboot, no password).
1 - IMPORTANT: make all current system information (like version and everything else) to be stored in the system core.
1 - IMPORTANT: add multiple tty support like how it is on linux, and always print in terminal which tty i am. (ctrl + alt + f1/f6) 
1 - Important: add --help and --version to ALL commands that still don't have it

0 - IMPORTANT: add/improve most system commands arguments (to be more robust like most linux distros):
Note for Gemini: Here, make a pretty long list of current and commands to add in future (with 1 or 0), with their arguments and also a description for them, like: 
  0 - `command1`: brief main description of the command
    0 - `command1 argument1:` a useful description
    0 - `command1 argument2:` a useful description
Make them all support multiple combinated arguments, like `rm -rf`, and multiple args, like `rm -r -f`
