  How to Test:
  To verify that everything is working as intended (specifically the input and utilities), follow these steps:

   1. Rebuild and Start GeminiOS:

   1     ./build.sh
   2     qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom GeminiOS.iso -m 1G -vga std -enable-kvm

   2. Test `xinit` and Input:
      Instead of running Xorg directly, use xinit. This will start X and try to run a default client (usually just a terminal or nothing if not configured).

   1     xinit
       * Verify the screen turns black/gray with the "X" cursor.
       * Verify the cursor moves with your mouse.
       * Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or whatever your QEMU setup uses to switch back to TTY) and then Ctrl+C in the terminal to kill X.

   3. Test `setxkbmap`:
      Since we don't have a window manager yet, you can test if the utility runs without library errors:
   1     setxkbmap -layout br -print
       * This should output the XKB configuration for the Brazilian layout without crashing or complaining about missing .so files.

   4. Integration Test (The "Poor Man's Desktop"):
      You can try to run a command automatically when X starts:

   1     xinit /bin/apps/snake -- :0
       * If successful, this will start X and run the Snake game inside it (though Snake is likely a CLI app, this tests if xinit can pass arguments and manage a session).
